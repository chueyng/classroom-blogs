##Specially Thanks To:
Sylvian shared me about twitter-bootstrap gem which speed up my project's layout. Joel gave me very explicit idea about my draft project's flow, and also guide me how to sort out some routing issues when I was having stuck thought. Jack told me that I should keep email's password into .yml secret file and stated it at gitignore file, where tells Git which files to ignore.

I am new to Ruby on Rail, and I really enjoy the moment of getting know it better in day-to-day basis. There is a lots space to improve my knowledge with this regard specifically on routing modules.
